    <p>
    This app has three major functions:<br/>
    * Battery temperature warning: Plays a tone if the charger is plugged at a specified time. The intention is to check for example at bed time, to avoid charging the device during night.<br/>
    * Scheduled time warning: Plays a tone if the battery temperature gets too high.<br/>
    * Fully charged warning: Plays a tone when the battery gets fully charged, so you don\'t charge longer than needed<br/></p>
    <p></p>
     <p>With the settings, you are able to:<br/><br/>
      * Enable/disable the warnings<br/>
      * Set time for the scheduled warning.<br/>
      * Decide which tone to play<br/>
      * Set the tone\'s sound volume<br/>
      * Decide if the tone should be played at even if device is muted
